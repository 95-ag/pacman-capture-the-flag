# pacman-ctf
A multiagent implementation for the Berkeley Pacman CTF (Competetive two-team Pacman)

The approach uses Mini-max to predict enemy movement, as well as Bayes' Inference to estimate opponent positions.

The file (Multiagent_PacMan_report.pdf)[https://github.com/befunger/pacman-ctf/blob/main/Multiagent_PacMan_report.pdf] contains a report outlining the design of our implementation.
